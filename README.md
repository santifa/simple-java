simple-java
===========

Here I show you some simple java programs witch I wrote to learn
about some techniques or frameworks. Something like Google Guice
and dependency injection.

All java programs are written with Eclipse and OpenJDK7.
All projects are managed with Maven and are part of the 
maven parent project simple-java.
