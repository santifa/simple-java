simple-java
===========

Here I wrote some simple java programs to learn some techniques or frameworks.

All java programs are written with Eclipse and OpenJDK7.
All projects are managed with Maven and are part of the 
maven parent project simple-java.

Current Subprojects are:
* Google Guice
* SQLite
* TDD: Every commit in this submodule is an iteration in the tdd development cycle
